		- given the transaction items-> write freq of each items
		- Frequent pattern set F1 -> built using removing all non support items
		- Apriori prunning Principle : If item(/set) is infrequent, its superset should not be generated
		- ```python
		  while fk != null:
		    ck+1 = generate(fk)
		    fk+1 = generate_f(ck+1)
		    k = k+1
