- What is Deep Learning?
	- ((678007b3-effa-477d-a5ff-6f13341d227c))
	- Based on computational models called neural networks
- What are neural networks?
	- $h=\sum_{i=1}^{M}wi.xi$
	- $y=a\left\lbrack h\right\rbrack$

- Examples of Supervised learning
	- Regression, Multivariate Regression, Binary Classification, Multiclass Classification
- Types of Supervised Learning
	- Regression Problem : Model predicts real values
	- Classification problems: Model predicts discrete values
	- Simplest model => Linear Model => $f\left(x;\theta\right)=\theta0+\theta1.x$ => can only describe relationship as line.

- Piecewise Linear Function
	- can be made with help of activation function
	- Step or ReLU function
