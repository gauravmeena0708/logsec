	- ## Matter
		- Paracetamol or Ibuprofen
		- Body temperature data - effect of anger on body temperature
		- Control Group - test group
		- Paired study
		- Statistical significance
		- In cancer Cells, as they are aggressive, more blood flow will be there
		- Bio-mechanics - Gait Analysis
			- What posture gives best outcome for fast bowlers
			- Predicting parkinsons
	- ## Data
		- Qualitative vs Quantitative
		- Subjective vs Objective
- # Lecture 3
	- Biomedical Data Sources
		- Height, Weight, Glucose level
		- ECG, Cancer imaging
		- Gait Data, sensor output
	- types:
		- Direct measurement, semi-quantitative, quantitative
		- needs to be summarised
	- Population vs. sample data
		- Example -Exit Polls vs Actual election results
		- Sample selection is very important
			- should be representative
			- should not be biased
		- Sample data is used to draw inferences about the population
		- statistics
			- Descriptive - mean, median, mode, std dev, range, percentile, quartile, variance, expected value, skewness(left skewed or right skewed), kurtosis(narrow peak or wide flat), inter quartile range
			- plots - Box and whisker plot(whisker is Q1-1.5IQR )
			-
			- Inferential
