	- ## Matter
		- Association rule mining
			- What is support? - It should have happened in n transactions
			- what is confidence? - Probability of A->B / Probability of A
			- $S=\frac{\left|AUB\right|}{\left|T\right|}$
			- $C=\frac{\left|AUB\right|}{\left|A\right|}$
		- Frequent set mining
			- Any set having S>=s
			- Monotonicity of freq of set
				- if item A has not crossed s, A->B will not be counted
			- for N items $2^{n}-1$ combination of subset can be possible

- # Lecture 2
	- ## Apriori Principle
		- If Itemset is frequent, all its subset must be frequent
	- ## Association Rule mining
		- [[Apriori Principle Association Rule Mining and Frequent Itemset Mining]]
		- TODO Upload the assest and link the correct page here
	- ## Frequent Itemset Mining
		- Naive Approach
			- Generate Candidate - > check support - if frequent accept else throw
			- Total possible subsets - $2^{n}-1$
			- Impractical
		- TODO Prove Fn X Fn will give all subsets of Fn+1
		- TODO while calculating C3, Why discarding the size 4 is advised?
			- if size 4 is frequent. All its subset of size 3 must be frequent. Hence Size 3 subsets must have been generated. Hence, all combos of size 4 will be generated from size 3 and no information is lost while discarding the size 4 generated by multiplying F2 X F2
		- C1 -> F1 -> C2 -> F2 -> C3 -> F3 -> ...
		- If we are trying to form size k, we have to merge two subset which have atleast k-2 items common
