	- ## Matter
		- Association rule mining
			- What is support? - It should have happened in n transactions
			- what is confidence? - Probability of A->B / Probability of A
			- $S=\frac{\left|AUB\right|}{\left|T\right|}$
			- $C=\frac{\left|AUB\right|}{\left|A\right|}$
		- Frequent set mining
			- Any set having S>=s
			- Monotonicity of freq of set
				- if item A has not crossed s, A->B will not be counted
			- for N items $2^{n}-1$
