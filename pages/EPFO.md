# Problems
	- ## Core Problems
		- Database is not centralised
		- Double entry book keeping system not in place
		- Old Fragmented Policies and Manual of accounting Procedure
	## Policy Management
		### Problems

		- **Lack of Policy Governance:**
			-  There is no formal process for creating, reviewing, or approving policies.
			- This leads to inconsistent, ad-hoc policy creation, causing confusion and inefficiency.
		- **Circular Management:**
			- Circulars lack version control, making it difficult to track changes and understand the current policy.
			- Policy changes are made without a formal review process, leading to issues and inconsistencies.
			- Changes done without impact analysis.
			- Circulars are often changed without any reference to the document they are changing.
		- **Complex Language:**
			- Policy documents and rules are written in a complex, legalistic style that is difficult for the average person to understand.
			- This requires people to consult with experts.
		### Ideas
		- **Policy Development Framework:**
			- Create a formal policy for policy creation, including steps for drafting, review, approval, and communication. (Addresses "Lack of Policy Governance" and part of "Circular Management".)
		- **Version Control System:**
			- Implement a version control system for all policy documents and circulars. (Addresses "Circular Management".)
		- **Standardized Circular Format:**
			- Develop a standard format for circulars that clearly indicates:
				- The document being amended.
				- The previous text and the new text. (Addresses "Circular Management".)
				- The author of change.
				- The approver of change.
				- The impact analysis document link.
		- **Plain Language Drafting:**
			- Establish guidelines for writing policy documents and rules in clear, concise language, avoiding unnecessary legal jargon.
		- **Impact Analysis:**
			- Implement a change impact analysis policy for any policy/circular change.

	- ## Establishment Identity Verification
		- A pensioner getting pension of 1000 Rs. per month has to file LC every year.
		- But there is no proper system for ensuring identity and running condition of Establishment.
		- Even without Human intervention, system can be made where establishment has to submit its ownership information and it should be verified with third party or sister agency data such as Income tax. GST etc.
		- This should be common for all sister agencies and mandatory to access the business's bank account and other facilities
	- ## IT System
		- Decentralized -different databases, different portals for compliance, Claim, Pension, Grievance
		- IT manpower - out of about 600 only ~30 in place. That too with old knowledge
		- No proper intranet vs internet, vpn etc
		- No clarity in responsibility of people posted in ISD
	- ## Manpower and Hiring
		- Irregular Hiring
		- Unorganised Service
		- Theoretically impossible workload
		- No policy of work life balance
		- No history of work and activities done by an employees (it should directly come in APAR, like settled X Claims, Resolved n grievances)
		- Inter-batch rivalries or batch wise interests
		- Social security of its own employees
	- ## Ministry
		- Focus on actual need of social security vs banking organisation
		- Long term gains vs short term gains
		- Need of social security
		-
	- ## Claim Processing
		- Simplify claims and their processing
		- Remove purpose based claims like electricity, illness, handicap etc. (users may optionally write select the reason from list or select any other reason)
	- ## Compliance
		- Simplify the membership and contribution requirement.
		- Increase awareness through TV and other Media such as youtube -> collaboration with Fin-influncers
		- solves:
			- coverage of all eligible employees
			- 7Q penalties
			- Handle legal cases more efficiently
- ## Examples
	- More than 24hours workload in KR Puram
	- Security team at IIT - Principal employer is liable but can't pay
	- Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya - daily wagers membership
	- Pension to IW/Higher wages
	- Chennai Audit team - Inoperative Account
	- 2.5 lakh to 15 lakh per annum
	- Group A - Clerical or managerial - OIC workload
	- Establishment LC/Identification - blackmail of marking as dead
	- Delegation/work clarity in ISD
	- SMS -> Claim is under process and will be settled shortly
	- Split of IBM and Kyndryl
	- KR Puram fraud Investigation
	- Social security of its own employees - Insurance, Medical cost?
- ## Ideas
	- Policy for policy creation, management and obsolescence
	- Policy for audit of policy before change/impact assessment test
	- Version control system for policy management
	- Standard format of policy change circulars- "This word" to "that word"
		- Reduction of discretion
	- EDLI
	- Separation of managerial and clerical tasks
	- Establishment health monitoring, ratings
	- Public APIs for data analysis
	- Unique Identifier of establishment, central database, centralized pension
	- Github
	- Gamification
