# Problems
	- ## Core Problems
		- Database is not centralised
		- Double entry book keeping system not in place
		- Old Fragmented Policies and Manual of accounting Procedure
	- ## Policy
		- Adhoc Policy making - There is no policy of policy making.
		- Circulars - No version control.  Irrational changes.
		- Policy Circulars should have a standard format and should convey in What document "Which words" have been replaced with "Which words"
		- Rules - Hard to understand by common man. Need of experts or consultant
	- ## Establishment Identity Verification
		- A pensioner getting pension of 1000 Rs. per month has to file LC every year.
		- But there is no proper system for ensuring identity and running condition of Establishment.
		- Even without Human intervention, system can be made where establishment has to submit its ownership information and it should be verified with third party or sister agency data such as Income tax. GST etc.
		- This should be common for all sister agencies and mandatory to access the business's bank account and other facilities
	- ## IT System
		- Decentralized -different databases, different portals for compliance, Claim, Pension, Grievance
		- IT manpower - out of about 600 only ~30 in place. That too with old knowledge
		- No proper intranet vs internet, vpn etc
		- No clarity in responsibility of people posted in ISD
	- ## Manpower and Hiring
		- Irregular Hiring
		- Unorganised Service
		- Theoretically impossible workload
		- No policy of work life balance
		- No history of work and activities done by an employees (it should directly come in APAR, like settled X Claims, Resolved n grievances)
		- Inter-batch rivalries or batch wise interests
		- Social security of its own employees
	- ## Ministry
		- Focus on actual need of social security vs banking organisation
		- Long term gains vs short term gains
		- Need of social security
		-
	- ## Claim Processing
		- Simplify claims and their processing
		- Remove purpose based claims like electricity, illness, handicap etc. (users may optionally write select the reason from list or select any other reason)
	- ## Compliance
		- Simplify the membership and contribution requirement.
		- Increase awareness through TV and other Media such as youtube -> collaboration with Fin-influncers
		- solves:
			- coverage of all eligible employees
			- 7Q penalties
			- Handle legal cases more efficiently
- ## Examples

	- Pension to IW/Higher wages
	- Chennai Audit team - Inoperative Account
	- 2.5 lakh to 15 lakh per annum

	- Split of IBM and Kyndryl
	- KR Puram fraud Investigation
	- Social security of its own employees - Insurance, Medical cost?
- ## Ideas

	- Policy for audit of policy before change/impact assessment test
	- Version control system for policy management
	- Standard format of policy change circulars- "This word" to "that word"
		- Reduction of discretion
	- EDLI
	- Separation of managerial and clerical tasks
	- Establishment health monitoring, ratings
	- Public APIs for data analysis
	- Unique Identifier of establishment, central database, centralized pension
	- Github
	- Gamification
