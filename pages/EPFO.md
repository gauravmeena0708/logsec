	- Circulars - No version control
- ## IT System
	- Decentralized
	- IT manpower
- ## Manpower
- ## Hiring
- ## Ministry
- ## Claim Processing
	- Simplify claims and their processing
	- Remove purpose based claims like electricity, illness, handicap etc. (users may optionally write select the reason from list or select any other reason)
- ## Compliance

- ## Examples
	- More than 24hours workload in KR Puram
	- Security team at IIT - Principal employer is liable but can't pay
	- Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya - daily wagers membership
	- Pension to IW/Higher wages
	- Chennai Audit team - Inoperative Account
	- 2.5 lakh to 15 lakh per annum
	- Group A - Clerical or managerial - OIC workload
	- Establishment LC/Identification - blackmail of marking as dead
	- Delegation/work clarity in ISD
	- SMS -> Claim is under process and will be settled shortly
	- Split of IBM and Kyndryl
- ## Ideas
	- Policy for policy creation, management and obsolescence
	- Policy for audit of policy before change/impact assessment test
	- Version control system for policy management
	- Standard format of policy change circulars- "This word" to "that word"
