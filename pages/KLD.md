- Measure of How one probability distribution is different from a second, reference distribution.
- **Measure of difference between two distributions**
- X = {x1, x2, x3...xn} -> diff between $p_{\theta}\left(X_1\right)\&q_{\phi}\left(x1\right)$
- as probabilities are very small ... we take log of the same
