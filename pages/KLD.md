- Measure of How one probability distribution is different from a second, reference distribution.
- **Measure of difference between two distributions**
- X = {x1, x2, x3...xn} -> diff between $p_{\theta}\left(X_1\right)\&q_{\phi}\left(x1\right)$
- as probabilities are very small and which will need to be multiplied with other small numbers... we take log of the same
- log ptheta(x1) - log qphi(x1) or likelihood ratio = $\frac{p_{\theta}(x)}{q_{\phi}(x)}$
-
- $D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\theta}\|Q_{\phi})=\int p_{\theta}(x)\log\frac{p_{\theta}(x)}{q_{\phi}(x)}\,dx$
