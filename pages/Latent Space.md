- [[Latent Space]]
	- Generative models often maps to a latent space (secret/hidden space) eg N(0,1).
	- By ensuring the latent space follows a known distribution, we can sample from it to generate new data
- How the [[Generative AI]] works?
	- We start from a basic distribution. $q\theta$
	- Loop -> find the difference between $P_{\theta}$ and $Q_{\phi}$ by either cross [[Entropy]] or [[KLD]]
		- adjust $Q_{\phi}$ with loss and again find loss ... and continue
		- once loss is minimized -> Generate samples from $Q_{\phi}
