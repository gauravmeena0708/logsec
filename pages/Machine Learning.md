## Three major types
	- Supervised Learning
		- Labelled data
		- Direct Feedback
		- Predict Outcome/feature/future
	- Unsupervised Learning
		- No labels/Target
		- No Feedback
		- Find Hidden Structure in Data
	- Reinforcement Learning
		- Decision Process
		- Reward System
		- Learn Series of Actions
	- ### How Supervised Learning works
		- Labels and Training Data Generate + Algo -> Machine Learning Model
		- New Data -> Model -> Prediction
		- Classification, Regression
	- ### How Unsupervised Learning Works
		- Clustering
		- Dimensionality Reduction
	- ### How Reinforcement Learning Works
		- Environment-> Reward, State -> Agent -> Action -> Environment
- ## Process Flow
	- Raw Data Collection
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Pre-Processing
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Missing Values and Null Value handling
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Initial Feature Selection
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- DataSet -> Split in Training Dataset, Test Dataset
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Pre-Processing of Training DataSet -> Feature Scaling, Feature extraction, Dimensionality Reduction
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
