## Three major types
	- Supervised Learning
		- Labelled data
		- Direct Feedback
		- Predict Outcome/feature/future
	- Unsupervised Learning
		- No labels/Target
		- No Feedback
		- Find Hidden Structure in Data
	- Reinforcement Learning
		- Decision Process
		- Reward System
		- Learn Series of Actions
- How Supervised Learning works
	- Labels and Training Data Generate + Algo -> Machine Learning Model
	- New Data -> Model -> Prediction
