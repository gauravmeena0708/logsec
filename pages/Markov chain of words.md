# **Markov Chain of Words**
- ## **What is a Markov Chain of Words?**
  A Markov Chain of Words is a probabilistic model used for generating text based on the Markov property. It treats words as states and predicts the next word in a sequence based on the current word (or a fixed number of previous words).

- ## **Key Concepts**
  1. **Markov Property**:
	- The next word depends only on the current word (or the last few words).
	- Example (1st-order):  
	  \( P(w_{n+1} | w_1, w_2, ..., w_n) = P(w_{n+1} | w_n) \)
	  
	  2. **States**:
	- Words or phrases in the text corpus.
	  
	  3. **Transition Probabilities**:
	- Probabilities of transitioning from one word to the next, derived from the frequency of word pairs or n-grams in the training text.
	  
	  4. **Transition Matrix**:
	- A matrix representing the probabilities of moving from one word to another.
	  
	  5. **N-Grams**:
	- Higher-order models (e.g., bigrams, trigrams) consider sequences of \( n \)-words for more context.

- ## **How it Works**
  1. **Training**:
	- Analyze a text corpus to compute transition probabilities between words or phrases.
	  2. **Generation**:
	- Start with an initial word or phrase.
	- Use the transition probabilities to probabilistically select the next word.
	- Repeat until the desired text length is achieved.

- ## **Applications**
  1. **Text Generation**:
	- Poetry, stories, or dialogue generation.
	  2. **Autocomplete**:
	- Predicting the next word or phrase in typing applications.
	  3. **Text Analysis**:
	- Modeling language for understanding structure and patterns.
	  4. **Chatbots**:
	- Creating rule-based conversational agents.
	  
	  ---
- ## **Advantages**
- Simple to implement and computationally efficient.
- Provides a baseline for language modeling tasks.
- Effective for small to medium-sized text corpora.

- ## **Limitations**
  1. **Context Limitation**:
	- Low-order Markov chains (e.g., 1st-order) fail to capture long-term dependencies.
	  2. **Poor Grammar**:
	- Generated text may lack coherent grammar and meaning.
	  3. **Scalability**:
	- Transition matrix size grows rapidly with vocabulary size or higher \( n \).
	  4. **Repetition**:
	- May produce repetitive or unrealistic sequences.

- ## **Example**
- ### **Corpus**:
  "I love programming. Programming is fun."
- ### **Transition Probabilities (Bigram Model)**:
- \( P(\text{love | I}) = 1.0 \)
- \( P(\text{programming | love}) = 1.0 \)
- \( P(\text{is | programming}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{fun | is}) = 1.0 \)
- ### **Generated Sentence**:
  "I love programming. Programming is fun."
