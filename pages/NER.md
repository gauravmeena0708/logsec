- BIO Tagset - Begin, Inside, Out
- if Barak Obama -> B-Per B-Per -> it means Barak and obama are two different persons
- If it is two word name of single person it should be -> B-Per I-Per
- Barak obama will travel -> B-Per I-Per O O
- Why [[HMM]]s are not good fit?
	- Lot's of O's
	- Insufficient features/capacity with multinomials (especially for unks)
- Solution Conditional random fields or CRFs
	- P(y|x) = $\frac{1}{z}\prod_{k}^{}\exp\left(\phi k\left(x,y\right)\right)$
	- Sequential CRF one of the architechture
- points
	- In HMM, emissions consider one word at a time.
	- CRFs support features over many words simultaneously, non-independent, featues (suffix and prefix),
