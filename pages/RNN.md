	- How to give input to NN? -> Vectorize
		- One-hot
		- Bag of words
		- Tf-IDF
	- Problem
		- One vector for each word
		- pass vector of each word of sentence as input
		- if vector size is 12, 4 word sentence will have input size of 48 and 5 word sentence will have input of 60.
		- lets say vocab is of 10000 words -> 5 word sentence would have 950000 as zero padding if max sentence has 100 as length
		- Issues: variable leg
