- Steps
	- Autoencoding using VAE -> Data to simplified, continuous representation(latent space)
		- Feature tokenizer
		- Transformer Encoder
		- Transformer Decoder
		- Detokenizer
		- Training the VAE
	- Latent Diffusion -> Learns the distribution of latent vectors and generates synthetic data from learnt distribution
		- Forward Diffusion Process
		- Reverse Diffusion Process
		- Sampling(Generating synthetic data)
	- Evaluation matrics
		- Low order statistics
			- Column wise Distribution similarity
				- Kolmogorov-smirnov test(KST) - For numerical columns difference between CDFs
				- Total Variation Distance (TVD) - For categorical cols->avg diff in probs for each cat
			- Pairwise column correlation
				- Pearson correlation coefficient - Linear Correlation between pairs
				- Contingency Similarity - difference between their contingency tables
				- combined numerical-categorical correlation: group num&cat via bucketing, -> cont. sim
			- Classifier two sample tests - measures difficulty to classify real and synthetic. high->good
		- Higher order Stats
			- Alpha precision - measures fidility - >
			- Beta Recall
		- Downstream tasks
			- Machine learning efficiency
			- Missing value imputation
		- Privacy Detection
			- Distance to closest record
