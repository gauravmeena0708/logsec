- It is a [[Generative AI]] method for generating synthetic tabular data after training from the real tabular data that includes both categorical and Numerical Data. It uses [[Diffusion]]
- Steps
	- Autoencoding using VAE -> Data to simplified, continuous representation [[Latent Space]]
		- Feature tokenizer
		- Transformer Encoder
		- Transformer Decoder
		- Detokenizer
		- Training the VAE
	- Latent Diffusion -> Learns the distribution of latent vectors and generates synthetic data from learnt distribution. Learning using [[KLD]] weights
		- Forward Diffusion Process
		- Reverse Diffusion Process
		- Sampling(Generating synthetic data)
	- Evaluation matrics
		- Low order statistics
			- Column wise Distribution similarity
				- Kolmogorov-smirnov test(KST) - For numerical columns difference between CDFs
				- Total Variation Distance (TVD) - For categorical cols->avg diff in probs for each cat
			- Pairwise column correlation
				- Pearson correlation coefficient - Linear Correlation between pairs
				- Contingency Similarity - difference between their contingency tables
				- combined numerical-categorical correlation: group num&cat via bucketing, -> cont. sim
			- Classifier two sample tests - measures difficulty to classify real and synthetic. high->good
		- Higher order Stats
			- Alpha precision - measures fidelity -> if each synthetic sample is close to real data
			- Beta Recall - measures coverage -> if synthetic data cover entire real distribution
		- Downstream tasks
			- Machine learning efficiency - train model(XGBoost) on synthetic and evaluate on real data
			- Missing value imputation - use tab syn to fill missing values and evaluate accuracy wrt real
		- Privacy Detection
			- Distance to closest record (DCR) - access potential privacy risks
	- Results
		- Performance - better in most esp column wise and pair wise
		- Fast
		- Effective for downstream tasks such as MLE, missing value imputation
	- Ablation Studies
		- Adaptive B VAE
		- Linear Noise Schedule
		- Comparison of different encoding methods
		- Impact of quality of VAE
		- Privacy protection
